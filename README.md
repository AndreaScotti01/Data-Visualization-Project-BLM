# Fatal Police Shooting in the US

The 2014 murder of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a protest that culminated in the Black Lives Matter movement and the growing public interest in police accountability and racism in the United States.

The Washington Post has been compiling, since January 2015, a database of all cases of homicide (by firearm) by police in the United States. At this link you will find a public Kaggle dataset that reports, in addition to the Post's, four other databases of demographic information. The Kaggle dataset refers to 2015-2016: at this link you will find the Post's updated database.

Finally, here is a database with the population of US cities.

# Requirements

Work should be delivered keeping in mind that the Jupyter notebook should be similar to a presentation to be shown to a hypothetical client: avoid projects that are too verbose and repetitive in analysis. Choosing what to show and why to show that concept over another is one of the skills to be developed for this project.

The project needs to be divided into 6 phases: 

Discovery (identification of the problem and objectives)

Data selection

Data cleaning

Data exploration

Data transformation

Data visualization
